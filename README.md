# Minutentag Beer â€” Front-End

This is the front-end application for the **Minutentag Beer** project, built with **React** and **Vite**. It connects to the back-end server to display beer products, manage user interactions, and perform operations like listing, filtering, and viewing product details.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

This front-end complements the [Minutentag Beer Server](https://github.com/pedrojose06/minutentag-server). It communicates with the server via **GraphQL** to fetch data such as beer listings and user information.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or above)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedrojose06/minutentag-beer
cd minutentag-beer
npm install
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## ðŸ”— Connecting to the Server

Make sure the [Minutentag Beer Server](https://github.com/pedrojose06/minutentag-server) is running at:

```
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You can configure the GraphQL endpoint inside your front-end code if needed (e.g., in a `.env` file or service file).

## ðŸ§ª Example Usage

The app will display a list of beers fetched via GraphQL. You can:

- View a list of beers
- Filter or search beers
- Click on a beer to see details
- Perform actions that trigger GraphQL queries or mutations
